# CSS-Only Direction-Aware Cube Links

A Pen created on CodePen.io. Original URL: [https://codepen.io/gabriellewee/pen/Qdpgwx](https://codepen.io/gabriellewee/pen/Qdpgwx).

Edit: I wrote a post about how to make these! Check it out [here](http://codepen.io/gabriellewee/post/how-to-create-direction-aware-css-only-hover-effects).

They're a little trigger-happy, but when I fixed them to be less sensitive, I lost the interesting rotations you get at each corner. I decided they're better as-is.
